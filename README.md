# Data-Analysis-Training-Cohort-3-With-Promise Nonso 
This is showing the tasks completed on microsoft excel from the classes taken by Promise Nonso

# INTRODUCTION: 
As part of the learning process for the 3rd cohort class held by Promise Nonso, tasks were assigned to 20 rows of information having the fields below: 
Employee ID
Employee Full Name
Department (Communications, Sales, I.T)
Salary (between $5000 to $25000)
Job type (Part-time, Freelance, Contract)

# ACTIVITY:

In worksheet 1, I showed employees who are ‘Freelancers’ and highlight the ones whose salaries are above $10000, 
In worksheet 2, I splitted the employees’ full names into first name and last name. Check for duplicates and highlight if any (do not delete)
In worksheet 3, highlight employees whose names begin with the letter ‘E’ (in yellow). Formatted the Salary column such that the highest SALARY has a green background and the lowest SALARY has a red background.

# SKILLS DEMOSTRATED: 

- Data processing 
- Use of Sort and Filter 
- Use of Conditional Formating
- Use of Text-Column

# DATA PROCESSING: 
The attached screenshot (Raw Data Task 1) is a personnally constructed raw data of employees identity numbers, Full Names,Salary, and Job type.

On worksheet 1, in order for me to process only the employees with salaries above $10,000,I applied the Filter funtion on all the data headings, then selected the salary column by left-clicking and selecting greater than 10,000, this revealed only employees with salaries above $10,000, thereafter I applied the same filter funtion to the 'Job Type' column selecting only freelancers. This automatically provided the dataset for just freelancers who earned aboved $10,000 with their different identification numbers.

On worksheet 2, I used the Text-to-Column function to split the fullnames of the employees, into firstnames and lastnames on separate columns. This was done by highlighting the Fullname column then I clicked on the 'text-to-column', selected 'delimeted' then 'space' and highlight the required columns for the new names then click finish. This simply popped-up two new columns with their firstnames and lastnames as seen in 'worksheet 2' below. Thereafter I used the conditional formatting function to find duplicate names on the Firstname and LastName Column which was highlighted in red.

On Worksheet 3, 
To determine the employee's with the highest and lowest salary, I highlighted the salary column then selected the conditional formatting function to determine the 'Top 1 Value' by highlighting the cell background and the value with dark green colour, also applied the 'Bottom 1 value' to the salary column by highlighting the cell background and the value with dark red colour. I also used the filter function to select and highlight employee names that begins with 'E' then I filled the background colour with yellow.




# CONCLUSION 

The task was really insightful and opened my knowledge to every possible things excel could do. I'm looking forward to know more about microsoft excel and data analysis at large.
