# Data-Analysis-Training-Cohort-3-With-Promise Nonso 
This is showing the tasks completed on microsoft excel from the classes taken by Promise Nonso

# INTRODUCTION: 
As part of the learning process for the 3rd cohort class held by Promise Nonso, tasks were assigned to 20 rows of information having the fields below: 
Employee ID
Employee Full Name
Department (Communications, Sales, I.T)
Salary (between $5000 to $25000)
Job type (Part-time, Freelance, Contract)

# ACTIVITY:

In worksheet 1, I showed employees who are ‘Freelancers’ and highlight the ones whose salaries are above $10000, 
In worksheet 2, I splitted the employees’ full names into first name and last name. Check for duplicates and highlight if any (do not delete)
In worksheet 3, highlight employees whose names begin with the letter ‘E’ (in yellow). Formatted the Salary column such that the highest SALARY has a green background and the lowest SALARY has a red background.

# SKILLS DEMOSTRATED: 

- Use of Sort and Filter 
- Use of Conditional Formating
- Use of Text-Column

# CONCLUSION 

The task was really insightful and opened my knowledge to every possible things excel could do. I'm looking forward to know more about microsoft excel and data analysis at large.
